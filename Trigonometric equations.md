# Trigonometric Equations

Trigonometric equations involve trigonometric functions, such as sine, cosine, and tangent, and are solved for specific values of the variables involved. These equations commonly arise in various fields of mathematics, physics, and engineering. In this note, we will explore the techniques for solving trigonometric equations and provide a cheat sheet summarizing the important formulas and relationships.

## Solving Trigonometric Equations

### 1. Basic Techniques
- Simplify the equation using trigonometric identities and properties.
- Isolate the trigonometric function on one side of the equation.
- Apply inverse trigonometric functions to both sides of the equation.
- Solve for the variable using algebraic techniques.

### 2. Common Strategies
- Use periodicity properties of trigonometric functions to find solutions over a specific interval.
- Apply the [[unit circle]] or right triangles to visualize and solve equations involving trigonometric functions.
- Employ double-angle, half-angle, or sum/difference identities to simplify the equation before solving.
- Consider using trigonometric identities like the Pythagorean identity or reciprocal identities to rewrite the equation in a more solvable form.

### 3. Special Cases
- [[Quadratic Trigonometric Equations]]: Convert the equation into a quadratic form by using appropriate trigonometric identities, then solve the resulting quadratic equation.
- [[Exponential Trigonometric Equations]]: Apply logarithmic functions to transform the equation into a solvable form involving exponential functions.
- [[Trigonometric Equations with Multiple Angles]]: Use periodicity properties and trigonometric identities to identify all possible solutions within a given interval.

## Trigonometric Equations Cheat Sheet

- **Pythagorean Identities**:
  - $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$
  - $1 + \tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x)$
  - $1 + \cot^2(x) = \csc^2(x)$

- **Reciprocal Identities**:
  - $\csc(x) = \frac{1}{\sin(x)}$
  - $\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}$
  - $\cot(x) = \frac{1}{\tan(x)}$

- **Sum and Difference Identities**:
  - $\sin(A \pm B) = \sin(A)\cos(B) \pm \cos(A)\sin(B)$
  - $\cos(A \pm B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) \mp \sin(A)\sin(B)$
  - $\tan(A \pm B) = \frac{\tan(A) \pm \tan(B)}{1 \mp \tan(A)\tan(B)}$

- **Double Angle Identities**:
  - $\sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)$
  - $\cos(2x) = \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)$
  - $\tan(2x) = \frac{2\tan(x)}{1 - \tan^2(x)}$

- **Half Angle Identities**:
  - $\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(x)}{2}}$
  - $\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos(x)}{2}}$
  - $\tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(x)}{1 + \cos(x)}}$

- **Inverse Trigonometric Functions**:
  - $\sin^{-1}(x)$ (or $\arcsin(x)$): Returns the angle whose sine is $x$.
  - $\cos^{-1}(x)$ (or $\arccos(x)$): Returns the angle whose cosine is $x$.
  - $\tan^{-1}(x)$ (or $\arctan(x)$): Returns the angle whose tangent is $x$.
