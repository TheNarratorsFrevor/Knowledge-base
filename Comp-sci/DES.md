# DES (Data Encryption Standard)

## Overview

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm used for encrypting electronic data, developed by IBM in the 1970s. Once the official standard by the NBS (now NIST), DES is now largely obsolete due to vulnerabilities with its 56-bit key.

## Technical Specifications

- **Block Size**: 64 bits
- **Key Size**: 56 bits (with 8 parity bits)
- **Structure**: Feistel network with 16 rounds
- **Algorithm Type**: Symmetric, block cipher

## Components of DES

### 1. Initial Permutation (IP)
The 64-bit plaintext undergoes an initial permutation:
$$
IP(P) : P \rightarrow P'
$$
This permutation reorders bits, providing diffusion before rounds start. The inverse of this permutation, $IP^{-1}$, is applied at the end of encryption.

### 2. Key Schedule

DES uses a 56-bit key broken down over 16 rounds. Each round requires a subkey generated by permuting and splitting the original key:
1. **Permutation Choice 1 (PC-1)**: Selects 56 out of 64 bits.
2. **Round Shifts**: Each round shifts the key by a fixed number of bits.
3. **Permutation Choice 2 (PC-2)**: Reduces shifted keys to 48 bits for use in Feistel rounds.

The effective subkey for round $i$ is:
$$
K_i = PC2(\text{left-shift}(K, i))
$$

### 3. The Feistel Function (F)

Each DES round applies the [[Feistel function]] $F$ on the right half of the data, using the round subkey $K_i$. This function comprises:
1. **Expansion (E)**: Expands the 32-bit half-block to 48 bits.
2. **XOR with Subkey**: Each 48-bit expanded block is XORed with $K_i$.
3. **S-Boxes (Substitution)**: Comprises eight 6-to-4 bit S-boxes:
   $$
   S_i : \{0,1\}^6 \rightarrow \{0,1\}^4
   $$
   These non-linear mappings add confusion.
4. **Permutation (P)**: Permutes the 32-bit output of S-boxes.

The output of $F$ function, $F(R, K_i)$, is XORed with the left half.

### 4. Rounds

Each DES round performs:
$$
L_{i+1} = R_i
$$
$$
R_{i+1} = L_i \oplus F(R_i, K_i)
$$

These Feistel rounds offer diffusion and confusion, essential for security.

## Encryption and Decryption

1. **Encryption**: For a plaintext $P$, the algorithm applies $16$ rounds of the Feistel structure, following initial permutation $IP$.
2. **Decryption**: Uses the same process in reverse by applying $K_{16}, K_{15}, \dots, K_1$.

The full encryption operation:
$$
C = IP^{-1}(\text{Feistel}(IP(P), K_1, \dots, K_{16}))
$$

### Security Analysis

- **Key Size**: 56-bit key size renders DES susceptible to brute-force attacks.
- **Differential Cryptanalysis**: DES was designed with resistance to differential attacks in mind, though it is vulnerable by today's standards.
- **Linear Cryptanalysis**: DES shows some resistance here, but not sufficient for modern security.

## Successors

**Triple DES (3DES)**: Applies DES encryption three times, increasing security by effectively expanding the key length to 112 or 168 bits. However, 3DES is slower and also nearing obsolescence due to computational advances.

**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: NIST selected AES in 2001 as a replacement for DES due to its stronger security and efficiency.

## Summary

DES pioneered block ciphers in cryptography, but its 56-bit key has been broken by brute-force methods. Although foundational in cryptographic history, DES has largely been replaced by more robust algorithms such as AES.
