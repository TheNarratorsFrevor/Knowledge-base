In [[Devops]] and [[Linux]], a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Each process is identified by a unique number called a process ID (PID). A process is a running program. The operating system tracks processes through the use of process identifiers. A process identifier (PID) is a unique number that identifies a specific process. A PID is automatically assigned to each process when it is created on the system.
