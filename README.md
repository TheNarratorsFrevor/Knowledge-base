This is my main obsidian vault.
I try to organize it as much as possible, but can't always do that
most notes are summarized with AI, using the following prompt:

`I will give you a subject, you will write a page of obsidian note about that subject, it should cover the basics, advanced and have a small cheatsheet to the end of it, link other subjects with [[subject name]]. latex should be formatted like so: $inline$, $$newline$$. return raw md only, abs no emojies, keep a casual tone, don't sound like ai.`

For summarizing notes, the same prompt can be used with slight modifications.
An automatic sorting script is in the works.
