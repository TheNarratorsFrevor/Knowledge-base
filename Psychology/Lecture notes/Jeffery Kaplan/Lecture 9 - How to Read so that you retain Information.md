Essentially, you need a procedure to force yourself to interact with the semantic content of what you're reading.

#### Semantic content

It's just a fancy name for "The meanings of the words that you are reading"
you want a procedure that forces you to think through the idea of the text that you're reading, if you only read over the text you will not imprint the ideas and the knowledge inside that text onto your brain.

#### Marginalia

Is a word that means "Text printed in the margins of a printed word", basically there's text written in a page and around it is empty space, and in said empty space you can write your own notes, this is called marginalia.

What he is recommending is a very specific way of taking notes in the margins, and not just the action of taking notes, that'd be very boring.

#### Jeffery Kaplan's version of Marginalia

If you know how to drive a car, you're familiar with the feeling of zoning out, you suddenly realize oh, you don't remember consciously driving your car and the paths you take.
and this happens because after driving a lot you don't need to engage in the activity to do it, it just kinda becomes muscle memory and sorta just.. happens.
when reading, you want the exact opposite of this to happen.
What you want to do is you want to read with focus and going through the idea instead of having your eyes to go over them.

- One way of doing it is just to try really hard... well not really

even better, if you have a procedure that forces you to go through the material.

#### Here's the procedure:

- You read the first paragraph
- You summarize the entire paragraph in the margin using only and only one sentence
- Move on to the second paragraph
- You do the same in one sentence.
- Then you get to the third paragraph and read through it, this is where stuff gets interesting
- Instead of summarizing the third paragraph, in one sentence summarize the first and the second paragraph, and in a second sentence, summarize the third paragraph
- Then you move on to the fourth paragraph and read through it.
- When summarizing, again, you use two sentences, one for everything you've learned in the subject so far, and one for the current, fourth, paragraph.

and you repeat this procedure until the end of the subject, you're going to have to leave stuff out and that forces you to actively think about what to write and not.

#### Rest of the lecture

Then he went on and talked about the efficiency of the method, and pointed out how overtime you'll get better and faster at creating these recursive marginals, and how effective it is in generating you a good grade.
