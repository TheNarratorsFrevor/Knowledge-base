in this small 10 minute section of that hour and half section, initially he spoke about what would happen if you expose people to the things that they are avoiding.

#### If you expose people to the things that they are avoiding

	You know, if you take people (and I've told you this), and you expose them voluntarily
	to things that they are avoiding and are afraid of, you know,
	that they KNOW they need to overcome - in order to meet their goals, their self-defined goals.
	If you can teach people to stand up in the face of the things they're afraid of, they get stronger.
	And you don't know what the upper limits to that are.
	Because you might ask yourself, like:
	"If for 10 years, if you didn't avoid doing what you knew you needed to do,(By your own definitions, right? Within the value structure that you've created),
	to the degree that you've done that, what would you be like?"
	Well, you know, there are remarkable people who come into the world from time to time;
	and they're people who do find out over decades long periods,
	what they could be like, if they were, who they truly were. 


In conclusion to that he said: 

	And so, you could say: "well in part, perhaps the reason that you're suffering unbearably
	can be left at your feet, because you're not everything you could be, and you know it." And of course, that's a terrible thing to admit, and it's a terrible thing to consider. But there's real promise in it, right?



#### Wasting time

here, he talked about how much time gets wasted hating the things you do, stuff that makes you feel bad after you have done it.
then he claimed that this time is worth money (and money is good, surprisingly)
here's the transcript from the lecture:

	Because you know, my experience is with people, that we're probably running at about 51% of our capacity.
	I mean, you can think about this yourselves.
	I often ask undergraduates:
	"How many hours a day you waste?" or "How many hours a week you waste?"
	And the classic answer is, something like 4 to 6 hours a day.
	You know, inefficient studying, watching things on YouTube,
	that not only do you not wanna watch, that you don't even care about,
	that make you feel horrible about watching after you're done.
	That's probably 4 hours right there.
	Now, you think "well that's 20-25 hours a week,
	it's a 100 hours a month, that's 2,5 full work weeks,
	it's half a year of work weeks per year!
	And if your time is worth...
	$20 an hour, which is a radical underestimate - it's probably more like $50,
	if you think about it in terms of deferred wages,
	then if you're wasting 20 hours a week, you're wasting $50,000 a year.
	And you are doing that right now.
	And it's because you're young, wasting $50,000 a year is a way bigger catastrophe
	than it would be for me to waste it, because I'm not going to last nearly as long.
	And so, if your life isn't everything it could be, you could ask yourself:
	"Well, what would happen if you just stop wasting the opportunities, that are in front of you?"


#### Causes of suffering

Here he basically said imaging if people weren't total cunts:

	Well, and if we all got our act together collectively,
	and stop making things worse, because that's another thing people do all the time:
	not only do they NOT do what they should to make things better,
	they actively attempt to make things worse,
	because they're spiteful, or resentful, or arrogant, or deceitful, or..
	or homicidal, or genocidal, or all of those things all...
	...bundled together in an absolutely pathological package.
	If people stopped really, really trying just to make things worse,
	we have no idea, how much better they would get just because of that.
	So there's this weird dynamic, that's part of the existential system of ideas between
	human vulnerability, social judgment,
	both of which are major causes of suffering,
	and the failure of individuals to adopt the responsibility that they KNOW they should adopt.
	And that's the thing that's interesting too, is that

#### Conscience

He explained the idea of a conscience:

	one of the another things I've often asked my undergraduate classes, is...
	You know, there's this idea that people have a conscience.
	And you know what the conscience is.
	It's this feeling or voice you have in your head, just before you do something, that you know is stupid,
	telling you, that probably you shouldn't do that stupid thing.
	You don't have to listen to it, strangely enough,
	but you go ahead and do it anyways,
	and then of course exactly what the conscience told you
	was going to happen, inevitably happens,
	so that you feel even stupider about it than you would, if it happened by accident.
	Cause, you know...
	"I knew this was going to happen,
	I got a warning it was gonna happen,
	and I went and did it anyways."
	And the funny thing too, is that conscience operates within people, and we really don't understand what the hell that is.

He went on and explained what he thinks would happen if you were to abide your conscience for a few years, and the ideas of a life that you'd have.

	So you might say: well, what would happen, if you abided by your conscience for 5 years or for 10 years?
	What sort of position might you be in, what sort of family might you have, what sort of relationship might you be able to forge?
	And you can be bloody sure, that a relationship that's forged on the basis of who you actually are,
	is going to be a lot stronger and more welcome, than one that's forged on the basis of who you aren't.
	Now, of course that means that the person you're with, has to deal with the full...
	...force of you, in all your ability and your catastrophe - and that's a very, very difficult thing to negotiate.
	But if you do negotiate it - well, at least you have something, you have somewhere solid to stand,
	and you have somewhere to live, you have a real life.
	And it's a great basis, upon which to bring children into the world, for example,
	because you can have an actual relationship with them, instead of
	torturing them half to death, which is what happens in a tremendous- a tremendously large minority of cases.


The rest was about Solzhenitsyn's writings and I haven't read those and won't be taking notes on it soon, will go back to it once I've read the original text tho.
