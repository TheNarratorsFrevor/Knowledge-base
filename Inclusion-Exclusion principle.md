The **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle** is a powerful tool in combinatorics and probability for counting elements in the union of overlapping sets. When we need to find the number of elements in a union of sets (say, how many elements belong to at least one set), direct addition often leads to **overcounting**. Inclusion-exclusion helps us adjust for this by systematically subtracting overlaps.

Let's explore this principle, starting with two sets and expanding to general cases, applications, and examples.

## Inclusion-Exclusion for Two Sets

If we have two sets, $A$ and $B$, the principle states:
$$
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
$$

### Why It Works

When we add $|A|$ and $|B|$, elements in both $A$ and $B$ get counted twice (once in each set). Subtracting $|A \cap B|$ corrects this by removing the extra count for elements in both sets.

#### Example

Consider two groups of students:
- $|A| = 30$ students play soccer.
- $|B| = 25$ students play basketball.
- $|A \cap B| = 10$ students play both sports.

To find the number of students who play **at least one** of these sports:
$$
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 30 + 25 - 10 = 45
$$

## Inclusion-Exclusion for Three Sets

With three sets, $A$, $B$, and $C$, the principle becomes:
$$
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|
$$

### Why It Works

Here, we start by summing the individual set sizes. However, this sum includes each pairwise overlap (like $A \cap B$) twice, so we subtract these to correct the double-counting. But when we subtract each intersection of two sets, we have removed the intersection of all three sets ($A \cap B \cap C$) too many times—so we add it back.

#### Example

Consider three groups of students:
- $|A| = 30$ students play soccer.
- $|B| = 25$ students play basketball.
- $|C| = 20$ students play volleyball.
- $|A \cap B| = 10$ students play soccer and basketball.
- $|A \cap C| = 5$ students play soccer and volleyball.
- $|B \cap C| = 8$ students play basketball and volleyball.
- $|A \cap B \cap C| = 3$ students play all three sports.

Then,
$$
|A \cup B \cup C| = 30 + 25 + 20 - 10 - 5 - 8 + 3 = 55
$$

## General Formula for $n$ Sets

For $n$ sets $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$, the inclusion-exclusion principle states:
$$
|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n| = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k+1} \sum_{\substack{1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k \leq n}} |A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k}|
$$

### Breaking Down the Formula

This formula involves alternating sums:
- **Add** the sizes of each individual set.
- **Subtract** each pairwise intersection.
- **Add** each intersection of three sets, and so on.
- **Continue alternating** between adding and subtracting until all intersections are included.

The use of $(-1)^{k+1}$ ensures that we alternate between adding and subtracting as needed.

## Applications of Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

### 1. Counting Elements in Overlapping Groups

In combinatorics, inclusion-exclusion allows us to calculate the size of unions in complex scenarios, such as counting students enrolled in multiple classes or members with overlapping skills.

### 2. Probability of Union of Events

In probability, inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the probability that **at least one** of several events occurs:
$$
P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) + P(A \cap B \cap C)
$$

This formula can extend to $n$ events using the general inclusion-exclusion formula.

### 3. Euler’s Totient Function

The **Euler totient function** $\varphi(n)$, which counts integers up to $n$ that are coprime with $n$, is computed using inclusion-exclusion to account for prime factors of $n$. This is because numbers not coprime to $n$ are divisible by its prime factors, so inclusion-exclusion helps adjust for multiples of these factors.

### 4. Counting Derangements

A **derangement** is a permutation with no fixed points (no element is in its original position). Inclusion-exclusion can determine the number of derangements by counting all permutations and systematically subtracting those with fixed points.
