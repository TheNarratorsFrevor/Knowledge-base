# Central Tendency

Central tendency is a statistical concept that describes the central or typical value in a set of data. It provides a measure of where the data tends to cluster or concentrate. In this section, we'll explore three commonly used measures of central tendency: the mean, median, and mode.

## Mean

The mean, also known as the average, is the most common measure of central tendency. It is calculated by summing up all the values in a data set and dividing the sum by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to extreme values, as it takes into account every data point.

## Median

The median is the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the data set has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the data set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean, making it a useful measure for skewed distributions.

## Mode

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. It represents the peak or mode of the data distribution. A data set may have one mode, known as unimodal, or multiple modes, known as multimodal. If no value repeats, the data set is considered to have no mode. The mode is particularly useful for categorical or discrete data.

## Choosing the Appropriate Measure

The choice of which measure of central tendency to use depends on the type of data and the characteristics of the data set. Here are some guidelines:

- Use the mean when the data set is numeric, continuous, and normally distributed. However, be cautious when extreme values (outliers) are present, as they can disproportionately influence the mean.

- Use the median when the data set is skewed or contains outliers. The median is a resistant measure, meaning it is less affected by extreme values.

- Use the mode for categorical or discrete data, where the emphasis is on the most frequently occurring value or category.

It's important to consider the nature of the data and choose the measure that best represents the central tendency in a meaningful way.

## Example

Let's consider the following data set: 12, 15, 18, 9, 11, 15, 18, 20, 9.

- Mean: Add up all the values and divide by the total number of values: (12 + 15 + 18 + 9 + 11 + 15 + 18 + 20 + 9) / 9 = 127 / 9 = 14.11(approximately).

- Median: Arrange the values in ascending order: 9, 9, 11, 12, 15, 15, 18, 18, 20. The middle value is 15, so the median is 15.

- Mode: The value 9 appears twice, and the values 15 and 18 also appear twice. Therefore, this data set is multimodal, with modes at 9, 15, and 18.

In this example, the mean is affected by the presence of outliers (20), while the median and mode give a different perspective of the central tendency.
