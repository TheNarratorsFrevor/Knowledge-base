# Equations of Lines

In mathematics, lines are fundamental geometric objects that have various representations. One commonly used representation is the equation of a line. The equation of a line allows us to describe its position and properties in a mathematical form. In this section, we will explore different forms of equations for lines and their properties.

## Slope-Intercept Form

The slope-intercept form of a line is one of the most frequently used forms. It expresses a line's equation in terms of its slope and y-intercept. The equation is given as:

$$y = mx + b$$

Here, $m$ represents the slope of the line, and $b$ represents the y-intercept, which is the point where the line intersects the y-axis. By examining the slope and y-intercept, we can determine various properties of the line. For example, a positive slope indicates an upward-sloping line, while a negative slope indicates a downward-sloping line. Moreover, the y-intercept provides information about where the line intersects the y-axis.

## Point-Slope Form

The point-slope form of a line is another useful representation. It allows us to express the equation of a line in terms of a single point on the line and its slope. The equation is given as:

$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

In this form, $(x_1, y_1)$ represents a point on the line, and $m$ represents the slope. By knowing a point on the line and its slope, we can easily write its equation. This form is particularly useful when we have a specific point on the line and want to find its equation.

## General Form

The general form of a line's equation is written as:

$$Ax + By = C$$

Here, $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants. This form allows us to represent any line, including vertical lines and lines with undefined slopes. However, it doesn't provide immediate information about the slope or y-intercept. To convert the general form to slope-intercept form, we can solve the equation for $y$.

## Relationships and Formulas

Below, you'll find a summary of the relationships and formulas related to the equations of lines:

- Slope: The slope of a line can be calculated using the formula:
  $$m = \frac{{\Delta y}}{{\Delta x}}$$
  where $\Delta y$ represents the change in y-coordinates and $\Delta x$ represents the change in x-coordinates between two points on the line.

- Parallel Lines: Two lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal. In slope-intercept form, parallel lines have the same slope.

- Perpendicular Lines: Two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is -1. In slope-intercept form, the slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope $m$ is $-\frac{1}{m}$.

- Distance between a Point and a Line: The distance $d$ between a point $(x_0, y_0)$ and a line with equation $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by:
  $$d = \frac{{\lvert Ax_0 + By_0 + C \rvert}}{{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}}$$
