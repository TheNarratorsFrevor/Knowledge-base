The distance formula is a mathematical equation used to calculate the distance between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system. It utilizes the coordinates of the two points to determine the distance between them.

The distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In the Cartesian coordinate system, the distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:

$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2)}$

where d represents the distance between the two points.

Let's consider an example to illustrate how the distance formula works:

Example: Find the distance between the points A(2, 3) and B(5, 7).

Using the distance formula, we can calculate the distance between these two points:

d = √((5 - 2)^2 + (7 - 3)^2)  
= √(3^2 + 4^2)  
= √(9 + 16)  
= √25  
= 5

Therefore, the distance between points A(2, 3) and B(5, 7) is 5 units.
