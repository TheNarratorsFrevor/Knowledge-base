# Quadratic Trigonometric Equations

Quadratic trigonometric equations are equations that involve quadratic terms of trigonometric functions, such as $\sin^2(x)$, $\cos^2(x)$, or $\tan^2(x)$. These equations can be challenging to solve directly, but with the help of trigonometric identities and algebraic techniques, we can find solutions. In this note, we will explore the methods for solving quadratic trigonometric equations and provide a cheat sheet summarizing important formulas and relationships.

## Solving Quadratic Trigonometric Equations

### 1. Simplify the Equation
- Use trigonometric identities to simplify the equation and express it in terms of a single trigonometric function.
- Apply Pythagorean identities ($\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$, $1 + \tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x)$, $1 + \cot^2(x) = \csc^2(x)$) to eliminate squared terms.

### 2. Apply Algebraic Techniques
- Transform the equation into a quadratic equation in terms of a single trigonometric function.
- Substitute $u = \sin(x)$, $u = \cos(x)$, or $u = \tan(x)$ to simplify the equation into a standard quadratic form.
- Solve the resulting quadratic equation using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.

### 3. Check for Extraneous Solutions
- After obtaining the solutions of the quadratic equation, substitute them back into the original equation to check for extraneous solutions.
- Some solutions obtained may not satisfy the original equation due to the limitations of the trigonometric functions.
