## **Triangle Theorems**

We know that there are different types of triangles based on the length of the sides like a scalene triangle, isosceles triangle, equilateral triangle and we also have triangles based on the degree of the angles like the acute angle triangle, right-angled triangle, obtuse angle triangle.

Though there are many Geometry Theorems on Triangles but Let us see some basic geometry theorems. 

### **Theorem 1** 

In any triangle, the sum of the three interior angles is 180°.

**Example** 

Suppose XYZ are three sides of a Triangle, then as per this theorem; ∠X + ∠Y + ∠Z = 180°

### **Theorem 2**

If a side of the triangle is produced, the exterior angle so formed is equal to the sum of corresponding interior opposite angles. 

**Example** 

For a triangle, XYZ, ∠1, ∠2, and ∠3 are interior angles. And ∠4, ∠5, and ∠6 are the three exterior angles.

### **Theorem 3**

**The base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent.**

Suppose a triangle XYZ is an isosceles triangle, such that;

XY = XZ \[Two sides of the triangle are equal\]

Hence, 

∠Y = ∠Z

Where ∠Y and ∠Z are the base angles.

Now Let’s learn some advanced level Triangle Theorems.

Theorem 3: If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the midpoints of the other two sides, then the two sides are divided in the same ratio.

**Example** 

XYZ is a triangle and L M is a line parallel to Y Z such that it intersects XY at l and XZ at M. 

Hence, as per the theorem:

XL/LY = X M/M Z

###  **Theorem 4**

If a line divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side.

Suppose XYZ is a triangle and a line L M divides the two sides of triangle XY and XZ in the same ratio, such that;

XL/LY = X M/M Z

### **Theorem 5**

If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in the same ratio and hence the two triangles are similar.

Let ∆ABC and ∆PQR are two triangles.

Then as per the theorem,

AB/PQ = BC/QR = AC/PR (If ∠A = ∠P, ∠B = ∠Q and ∠C = ∠R)

And ∆ABC ~ ∆PQR

### **Theorem 6** 

If in two triangles, the sides of one triangle are proportional to other sides of the triangle, then their corresponding angles are equal and hence the two triangles are similar.
