## **Angle Theorems**

The relation between the angles that are formed by two lines is illustrated by the geometry theorems called “Angle theorems”. Some of the important angle theorems involved in angles are as follows:

### **1\. Alternate Exterior Angles Theorem**

When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal then resulting alternate exterior angles are congruent.

The alternate exterior angles have the same degree measures because the lines are parallel to each other.

### **2\. Alternate Interior Angles Theorem** 

When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal then resulting alternate interior angles are congruent.

The alternate interior angles have the same degree measures because the lines are parallel to each other.

One way to find the alternate interior angles is to draw a zig-zag line on the diagram.

### **3\. Congruent Complements Theorem**

If two angles are complementary to the same angle or of congruent angles, then the two angles are congruent.

### **4\. Congruent Supplements Theorem**

If two angles are supplements to the same angle or of congruent angles, then the two angles are congruent.

### **5.  Right Angles Theorem**

If two angles are both supplement and congruent then they are right angles.

### **6.  Same-Side Interior Angles Theorem**

If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary.

### **7.  Vertical Angles Theorem**

Angles that are opposite to each other and are formed by two intersecting lines are congruent.
