**Theorem 1: Equal chords of circle subtend equal angles at the centre.**

**Proof:**

> We are given two chords KL and JI. We need to prove that ∠KHL = ∠JHI.

> HI = HK

> So, both the triangles are congruent. Thus, both of these angles are equal. Hence, proved.

**Theorem:** **The line drawn through the centre of a circle to bisect a chord is perpendicular to the chord**

**Proof:** 

> Let PQ be the chord of a circle and OM be the line from the centre that bisects the chord. Here, M is the mid point of the chord, and we have to prove that ∠OMQ = 90°. 
> 
> In triangles ΔOPM and ΔOQM. 
> 
> PM = MQ (perpendicular bisects the chord) 
> 
> OP = OQ (radius of the circle) 
> 
> OM = OM (common side of both the triangles)
> 
> So, both these triangles are congruent. This gives, angles ∠OMQ and ∠OMP as 90°

> **Note:** The converse of this theorem “**The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord**” is also true.

**Theorem:** **The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is double the angle subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle.**

**Proof:**

> **Let’s consider three cases,** 
> 
> 1. Arc PQ is major arc. 
> 2. Arc PQ is minor arc.
> 3. Arc PQ is semi-circle.

> Let’s join AO and extend it to B. 
> 
> In all three cases, ∠BOQ = ∠OAQ + ∠OQA. (Exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite angles).

> Also in triangle ΔOAQ,

> OA = OQ (Radii of Circle)

> Therefore, ∠ OAQ = ∠ OQA

> ∠ BOP = 2∠OAP
> 
> from (1) and (2), ∠ BOP + ∠ BOQ = 2(∠ OAP + ∠ OAQ)

> Reflex angle POQ = 2∠PAQ

> Considering arc PQR, ∠POR = 2 ∠PSR, 
> 
> Similarly, considering PSR, reflex ∠POR = 2∠PQR
> 
> We know, ∠POR + reflex ∠POR = 360°.
> 
>               ⇒ 2 ∠PSR + 2∠PQR = 360°
> 
>              ⇒ 2(∠PSR + ∠PQR) = 360°
> 
>  ⇒ ∠PSR + ∠PQR = 180° 
> 
> Thus, sum of opposite angles of cyclic quadrilateral is 180°.
