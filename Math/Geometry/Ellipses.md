# Ellipses

An ellipse is a geometric shape that resembles a stretched or compressed circle. It is defined as the set of all points in a plane for which the sum of the distances to two fixed points, called the foci, is constant. The shape of an ellipse is characterized by its major axis, minor axis, eccentricity, and foci.

## Basic Definitions

- **Center**: The center of an ellipse is the midpoint of its major axis. It is the point equidistant from the two foci.
- **Major Axis**: The major axis is the longest diameter of the ellipse. It passes through the center and is perpendicular to the minor axis.
- **Minor Axis**: The minor axis is the shortest diameter of the ellipse. It passes through the center and is perpendicular to the major axis.
- **Foci**: The foci (plural of focus) are two fixed points inside the ellipse. The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant.
- **Semimajor Axis**: The semimajor axis is half the length of the major axis. It is denoted by "a."
- **Semiminor Axis**: The semiminor axis is half the length of the minor axis. It is denoted by "b."
- **Eccentricity**: The eccentricity of an ellipse is a measure of how elongated or compressed it is. It is defined as the ratio of the distance between the center and one of the foci to the length of the semimajor axis. It is denoted by "e."

## Equations and Relationships

The standard equation for an ellipse with center at the origin (0,0) is:

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

where "a" represents the semimajor axis and "b" represents the semiminor axis. The lengths of the major and minor axes are given by 2a and 2b, respectively.

The eccentricity of an ellipse can be calculated using the formula:

$$e = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}}{a}$$

The eccentricity of an ellipse lies in the range 0 ≤ e < 1. When e = 0, the ellipse degenerates into a circle, and when e = 1, the ellipse becomes a line segment.

The distance between the center of the ellipse and each focus is given by:

$$c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$$

## Properties

Ellipses possess various properties that are important to understand:

- **Symmetry**: An ellipse is symmetric with respect to both its major and minor axes. This means that if a point (x, y) lies on the ellipse, then (−x, y), (x, −y), and (−x, −y) also lie on the ellipse.
- **Foci and Constant Sum Property**: The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant. This property is used to define and construct ellipses.
- **Tangent**: A tangent to an ellipse at any point is perpendicular to the line segment connecting that point to the ellipse's foci.
- **Area**: The area of an ellipse is given by the formula: $$A = \pi ab$$, where "a" is the semimajor axis and "b" is the semiminor axis.
- **Circumference**: The circumference of an ellipse does not have a simple, closed-form formula. However, several approximations exist, such as Ramanujan's formula and numerical methods.
- **Conic Section**: An ellipse is a type of conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane and a cone. Other conic sections include circles, parabolas, and hyperbolas.

## Applications

Ellipses have various applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and other fields:

- **Astronomy**: Elliptical orbits are observed in celestial mechanics, where planets, comets, and satellites follow elliptical paths around their central bodies.
- **Optics**: The reflection and refraction of light by curved mirrors and lenses often involve ellipses.
- **Satellite Communication**: The elliptical shape of satellite orbits allows for continuous communication coverage as the satellite moves closer and farther from Earth.
- **Architecture and Design**: Elliptical shapes are often used in architecture for aesthetic appeal, such as in arches and windows.
- **Sports**: Many sports fields, such as running tracks and ice rinks, have elliptical shapes.
