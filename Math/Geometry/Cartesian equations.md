fCertainly! Cartesian equations are mathematical equations that relate the variables x and y using algebraic expressions. They represent the relationship between points in the Cartesian coordinate system. Here are examples of Cartesian equations along with their LaTeX formatting:

1. Linear Equation:  
    A linear equation represents a straight line in the Cartesian plane. It can be written in the form:  
    $$[y = mx + b]$$
    
    Example: (y = 2x + 3) represents a line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3.
    
2. Quadratic Equation:  
    A quadratic equation represents a parabolic curve. It can be written in the form:  
    $$[y = ax^2 + bx + c]$$
    
    Example: (y = x^2 - 4x + 4) represents a parabola that opens upwards, with its vertex at (2, 0).
    
3. Circle Equation:  
    The equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is given by:  
$$    [(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2]$$
     Example: ((x - 2)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 9) represents a circle with center at (2, -1) and radius 3.
    
4. Ellipse Equation:  
    The equation of an ellipse centered at the origin (0, 0) is given by:  
   $$ [\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1]$$
    
    Example: $(\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1)$ represents an ellipse with major axis 6 (2a) along the x-axis and minor axis 6 (2b) along the y-axis.
    
5. Hyperbola Equation:  
    The equation of a hyperbola centered at the origin (0, 0) is given by:  
    $$[\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1]$$
    
    Example: $(\frac{x^2}{9} - \frac{y^2}{4} = 1)$ represents a hyperbola with a transverse axis of length 6 (2a) along the x-axis and a conjugate axis of length 4 (2b) along the y-axis.
    

These are examples of Cartesian equations that help describe various geometric shapes and mathematical relationships.
