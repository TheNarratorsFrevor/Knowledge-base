The Cartesian plane, also known as the coordinate plane or xy-plane, is a two-dimensional geometric system that is formed by the intersection of two perpendicular lines called the x-axis and the y-axis. It is named after the mathematician and philosopher Ren√© Descartes, who introduced the Cartesian coordinate system.

The x-axis is a horizontal line that extends infinitely in both positive and negative directions. It serves as a reference line for measuring the horizontal position of points in the plane. The positive direction is conventionally assigned to the right side of the axis, and the negative direction is assigned to the left side.

The y-axis is a vertical line that also extends infinitely in both positive and negative directions. It serves as a reference line for measuring the vertical position of points in the plane. The positive direction is conventionally assigned to the upward direction, and the negative direction is assigned to the downward direction.

The point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect is called the origin and is denoted as (0, 0). It serves as the reference point for defining the coordinates of other points in the plane.

The Cartesian plane is divided into four quadrants by the x-axis and y-axis. These quadrants are labeled as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 in a counterclockwise direction. Each quadrant has a unique combination of positive and negative coordinates, allowing us to classify points based on their positions relative to the origin.

The Cartesian plane provides a systematic way to represent and analyze geometric figures, functions, and equations. It allows us to visualize relationships between points, lines, curves, and shapes. By using coordinates, we can precisely describe the location of any point in the plane and perform calculations such as finding distances, determining slopes, and plotting graphs.
