# Circles

A circle is a fundamental geometric shape that consists of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed center point. Circles have several properties and relationships that make them important in various mathematical and real-world applications.

## Basic Definitions

- **Center**: The center of a circle is the fixed point from which all points on the circle are equidistant. It is typically denoted by the letter "O" or "C."
- **Radius**: The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. It is usually denoted by the letter "r."
- **Diameter**: The diameter is the longest chord (segment connecting two points on the circle) that passes through the center. It is equal to twice the radius.
- **Circumference**: The circumference is the distance around the circle. It is calculated using the formula: $$C = 2\pi r$$, where $\pi$ (pi) represents the mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.
- **Chord**: A chord is a line segment connecting two points on the circle.
- **Secant**: A secant is a line that intersects the circle at two distinct points.
- **Tangent**: A tangent is a line that intersects the circle at exactly one point, called the point of tangency.

## Equations and Relationships

Circles possess several important equations and relationships that help describe their properties and interactions with other geometric figures:

- **Equation of a Circle**: The equation of a circle with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is given by the equation: $$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$$, where $(x, y)$ represents any point on the circle.
- **Pythagorean Theorem in a Circle**: In a right triangle where the hypotenuse is the diameter of a circle, and one of the legs is the radius, the other leg's length can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$, where $a$ and $b$ are the legs and $c$ is the hypotenuse (diameter).
- **Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem**: The angle formed between a tangent and a chord at their point of intersection is equal to the angle formed by the chord in the opposite arc.

## Circle Properties

Circles possess various properties that are important to understand:

- **Congruent Circles**: Two circles are congruent if they have the same radii.
- **Concentric Circles**: Concentric circles share the same center but have different radii.
- **Arc**: An arc is a portion of the circumference of a circle.
- **Sector**: A sector is the region enclosed by two radii of a circle and their intercepted arc.
- **Cyclic Quadrilateral**: A quadrilateral is cyclic if all four of its vertices lie on a circle.
- **Inscribed Angle**: An inscribed angle is formed by two chords in a circle that have a common endpoint.
- **Central Angle**: A central angle is formed by two radii extending from the center of a circle to the endpoints of an arc.

## Applications

Circles have numerous applications in various fields, including mathematics, engineering, and everyday life:

- **Geometry**: Circles are extensively studied in geometry and serve as a foundation for understanding more complex geometric shapes and concepts.
- **Trigonometry**: Circles are closely related to trigonometric functions and unit circles, which are used to define and study angles and their properties.
- **Architecture and Design**: Circles often appear in architectural designs, such as circular buildings or decorative patterns.
- **Engineering**: Circles are essential for designing and analyzing mechanical components, such as gears and pulleys.
- **Navigation**: Circles are used in navigation systems, such as compasses and GPS, to determine distances and directions.
