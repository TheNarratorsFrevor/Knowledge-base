### **1\. Angles**

Two rays emerging from a single point makes an angle.

### **2\. Linear Pair**

When two or more than two rays emerge from a single point. Then the angles made by such rays are called linear pairs.

### **3\. Parallel Lines**

When the perpendicular distance between the two lines is the same then we say the lines are parallel to each other.

### **4\. Vertically opposite angles**

If there are two lines crossing from one particular point then the opposite angles made in such a condition are equals.

Now that we are familiar with these basic terms, we can move onto the various geometry theorems. To make it easier to connect and hence apply, we have categorized them according to the shape the geometry theorems apply to.
