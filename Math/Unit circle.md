# Unit Circles

A unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 unit, centered at the origin (0,0) in a coordinate plane. Unit circles are widely used in mathematics, particularly in trigonometry, as they provide a convenient reference for understanding trigonometric functions and their properties.

## Definition

The equation of a unit circle can be given as:

$$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$

This equation represents all the points (x, y) that lie on the circle with a radius of 1. The unit circle is symmetric about both the x-axis and the y-axis, and it has a circumference of 2π units.

## Trigonometric Functions

The unit circle is closely associated with trigonometric functions, namely sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan). These functions relate the coordinates of a point on the unit circle to the angles formed by the ray extending from the origin to that point.

### Sine (sin) Function

The sine function, denoted as sin(θ), represents the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle corresponding to an angle θ. It can be defined as:

$$\sin(\theta) = y$$

### Cosine (cos) Function

The cosine function, denoted as cos(θ), represents the x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle corresponding to an angle θ. It can be defined as:

$$\cos(\theta) = x$$

### Tangent (tan) Function

The tangent function, denoted as tan(θ), represents the ratio of the sine function to the cosine function for a given angle θ. It can be defined as:

$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{{\sin(\theta)}}{{\cos(\theta)}}$$

## Trigonometric Identities

Unit circles also help establish various trigonometric identities that are essential in solving trigonometric equations and simplifying expressions. Some important identities are:

1. Pythagorean Identity:  
    $$\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$$
    
2. Reciprocal Identities:  
    $$\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{{\cos(\theta)}}$$  
    $$\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{{\sin(\theta)}}$$  
    $$\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{{\tan(\theta)}}$$
    
3. Quotient Identities:  
    $$\tan(\theta) = \frac{{\sin(\theta)}}{{\cos(\theta)}}$$  
    $$\cot(\theta) = \frac{{\cos(\theta)}}{{\sin(\theta)}}$$
    
4. Co-Function Identities:  
    $$\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \cos(\theta)$$  
    $$\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \sin(\theta)$$  
    $$\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \cot(\theta)$$
