# Parallelepipeds

A parallelepiped is a three-dimensional geometric shape that is defined by six parallelogram faces. It is a generalization of a parallelogram in two dimensions and a parallelepiped in three dimensions. In this note, we will explore the properties, formulas, and relationships related to parallelepipeds.

## Definition and Properties

A parallelepiped is characterized by the following properties:

1. **Faces**: A parallelepiped has six faces, each of which is a parallelogram.
2. **Edges**: It has 12 edges, where each edge is the intersection of two faces.
3. **Vertices**: A parallelepiped has eight vertices, which are the points where three edges meet.
4. **Opposite Faces and Edges**: Any two opposite faces of a parallelepiped are congruent and parallel to each other. Similarly, any two opposite edges are parallel.
5. **Diagonals**: The parallelepiped has three diagonals, which connect opposite vertices.
6. **Volume**: The volume of a parallelepiped is given by the base area multiplied by the height. The base area can be calculated as the cross product of two adjacent sides.

## Formulas and Relationships

Let's consider a parallelepiped with sides of lengths (a), (b), and (c), and angles (\alpha), (\beta), and (\gamma) between the sides. Here are some important formulas and relationships related to parallelepipeds:

1. **Volume**: The volume ((V)) of a parallelepiped is given by the base area ((A_b)) multiplied by the height ((h)):  
    $$V = A_b \cdot h$$
    
2. **Base Area**: The base area ((A_b)) can be calculated as the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides:  
    $$A_b = | \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} |$$
    
3. **Height**: The height ((h)) of the parallelepiped can be calculated as the perpendicular distance between the two parallel bases.
    
4. **Surface Area**: The surface area ((A_s)) of a parallelepiped can be calculated by summing the areas of its six faces:  
    $$A_s = 2 \cdot (ab + ac + bc)$$
    
5. **Diagonal Lengths**: The lengths of the three diagonals can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:  
    $$d_1 = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$$  
    $$d_2 = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$$  
    $$d_3 = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$$
    
6. **Relationship between Side Lengths and Angles**: The cosine rule can be used to relate the side lengths and angles of a parallelepiped:  
    $$a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \cos(\alpha)$$  
    $$b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cdot \cos(\beta)$$  
    $$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot \cos(\gamma)$$
    
7. **Relationship between Diagonals and Side Lengths**: The diagonals of a parallelepiped can be expressed in terms of its side lengths:  
    $$d_1^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab \cdot \cos(\gamma) + 2ac \cdot \cos(\beta) + 2bc \cdot \cos(\alpha)$$  
    $$d_2^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab \cdot \cos(\gamma) + 2ac \cdot \cos(\beta) + 2bc \cdot \cos(\alpha)$$  
    $$d_3^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab \cdot \cos(\gamma) + 2ac \cdot \cos(\beta) + 2bc \cdot \cos(\alpha)$$
