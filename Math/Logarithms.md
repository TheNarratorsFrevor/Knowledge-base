In mathematics, the logarithm is the [[Inverse function]] to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a given number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised, to produce that number.


Rule 1: Product Rule

![log base b of (MN) = log base b of (M) + log base b of (N)](https://www.chilimath.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rules-of-logarithms-product.gif)

The logarithm of the product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors.

Rule 2: Quotient Rule

![log base b of (M/N) = log base b of (M) - log base b of (N)](https://www.chilimath.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rules-of-logarithms-quotient.gif)

The logarithm of the ratio of two quantities is the logarithm of the numerator minus the logarithm of the denominator.

Rule 3: Power Rule

![log base b of (M^k) = (k) times ](https://www.chilimath.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rules-of-logarithms-power.gif)

The logarithm of an exponential number is the exponent times the logarithm of the base.

Rule 4: Zero Rule

![log base b of 1 equals zero where b>0](https://www.chilimath.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rules-of-logarithms-zero-rule.gif)

The logarithm of 111 such that b\>0b > 0b\>0 but bâ‰ 1 equals zero.

Rule 5: Identity Rule

![log base b of b is equal to 1, where b>1](https://www.chilimath.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rules-of-logarithms-identity-rule.gif)

The logarithm of the argument (inside the parenthesis) wherein the argument is the same as the base is equal to 111. Since the argument is equal to the base, bbb must be greater than 000 but it cannot equal to 111.

Rule 6: Log of Exponent Rule (Logarithm of a Base to a Power Rule)

![log base b of (b^k) equals k, where b>0](https://www.chilimath.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rules-of-logarithms-inverse-of-exponent.gif)

The logarithm of an exponential number where its base is the same as the base of the log is equal to the exponent.

Rule 7: Exponent of Log Rule (A Base to a Logarithmic Power Rule)

![b^(log base b of k) = k](https://www.chilimath.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rules-of-logarithms-inverse-of-log.gif)

Raising the logarithm of a number to its base is equal to the number.
