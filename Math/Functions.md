In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **function** from a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#cite_note-1) The set X is called the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function") of the function and the set Y is called the [codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain "Codomain") of the function.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

Functions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity. For example, the position of a [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") is a _function_ of time. [Historically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_function_concept "History of the function concept"), the concept was elaborated with the [infinitesimal calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_calculus "Infinitesimal calculus") at the end of the 17th century, and, until the 19th century, the functions that were considered were [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function") (that is, they had a high degree of regularity). The concept of a function was formalized at the end of the 19th century in terms of [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory"), and this greatly enlarged the domains of application of the concept.

A function is most often denoted by letters such as f, g and h, and the value of a function f at an element x of its domain is denoted by _f(x)_.

A function is uniquely represented by the set of all [pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_(mathematics) "Pair (mathematics)") (_x_, _f_ (_x_)), called the _[graph of the function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function")_.[\[note 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#cite_note-2)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#cite_note-3) When the domain and the codomain are sets of real numbers, each such pair may be thought of as the [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") of a point in the plane. The set of these points is called the graph of the function; it is a popular means of illustrating the function.

Functions are widely used in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), and in most fields of mathematics. It has been said that functions are "the central objects of investigation" in most fields of mathematics.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTESpivak200839-4) 

## Names

First, it is useful to give a function a **name**.

The most common name is "_**f**_", but we can have other names like "_**g**_" ... or even "_**marmalade**_" if we want.

But let's use "f":

![f(x) = x^2](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/images/function-fx-x2.svg)

We say _"f of x equals x squared"_

what goes **into** the function is put inside parentheses () after the name of the function:

So **_f(x)_** shows us the function is called "**_f_**", and "**_x_**" goes **in**

And we usually see what a function does with the input:

**_f(x) = x2_** shows us that function "_**f**_" takes "_**x**_" and squares it.

## The Two Important Things!

- "...each element..." means that every element in **X** is related to some element in **Y**.

We say that the function _**covers**_ **X** (relates every element of it).

(But some elements of **Y** might not be related to at all, which is fine.)

- "...exactly one..." means that a function is _**single valued**_. It will not give back 2 or more results for the same input.

So "f(2) = 7 **or** 9" is not right!


### 1. Constant Function

A function f:R→R defined by f(x)=c,∀x∈R is called a constant function. For example, the function f:R→R defined by f(x)=3,∀x∈R is graphed as:

### 2. Identity Function

A function f:R→R defined by f(x)=x,∀x∈R is called an identity function. An identity function is graphed as:

![](https://d2cyt36b7wnvt9.cloudfront.net/exams/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21204247/418.jpg)

### 3. Linear Function

A function f:R→R of the form f(x)=ax+b,∀x∈R is called a linear function. For example, the function f:R→R defined by f(x)=2x+3,∀x∈R is graphed as:

![](https://d2cyt36b7wnvt9.cloudfront.net/exams/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21204455/520.jpg)

Note that an identity function is a linear function with a=1 and b=0.

### 4. Modulus Function

A function f:R→R defined by f(x)=|x|,∀x∈R is called the modulus function. For negative values of x,f(x)=–x and for non-negative values f(x)=x.  
The graph of the function f(x)=|x| is drawn as:

![](https://d2cyt36b7wnvt9.cloudfront.net/exams/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21204837/613.jpg)

This function is also called the absolute value function.

### 5. Greatest Integer Function

A function f:R→R defined by f(x)=[x],∀x∈R where [x] represents the greatest integer less than the real number x, and this is called the greatest integer function. The symbol ⌊x⌋ is also used for the same.  
The domain of the greatest integer function is the set of real numbers, and the range is a set of integers.  
The graph of the greatest integer function is drawn as:

![](https://d2cyt36b7wnvt9.cloudfront.net/exams/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21205123/716.jpg)

This function is also called the floor function.

### 6. Smallest Integer Function

A function f:R→R defined by f(x)=⌈x⌉,∀x∈R, where ⌈x⌉ represents the smallest integer greater than the real number x is called the smallest integer function.  
As in the case of the greatest integer function, the domain of the smallest integer function is the set of real numbers, and the range is a set of integers.  
The graph of the smallest integer function is drawn as:

![](https://d2cyt36b7wnvt9.cloudfront.net/exams/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21205514/8-3.jpg)

This function is also called the ceiling function.

### 7. Signum Function

A function f:R→R

defined by  
f(x)={|x|x,∀x≠00,∀x=0  
is called the signum function.  
Another definition for the same is given by:  
f(x)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪10–1x>0x=0x<0

  
The graph of the smallest integer function is drawn as:

![](https://d2cyt36b7wnvt9.cloudfront.net/exams/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21205911/9-2.jpg)

The domain of the signum function is the set of real numbers, while the range is a finite set {–1,0,1}.

### 8. **Exponential Function**

A function f:R→R

defined by f(x)=ax,∀x∈R, and a>0,a≠1 is called an exponential function. For the values of a>1, the function’s value increases exponentially, and for 0<a<1, it approaches zero but never touches it.  
The graph of the function f(x)=ax

is drawn as:

### 9. Logarithmic Function

For a>0

and a≠1, a function f:(0,∞)→R defined as f(x)=x,∀x>0, is called logarithmic function. For the values of a>1, the function’s value increases exponentially, and for 0<a<1, it decreases.  
The graph of the function f(x)=x

is drawn as:

![](https://d2cyt36b7wnvt9.cloudfront.net/exams/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21210708/1112.jpg)

The logarithmic and exponential functions are inverses of each other.

### 10. Polynomial Function

A function f:R→R is said to be a polynomial function if it is defined as f(x)=a0+a1x+a2x2+…+anxn,∀x∈R,n is a non-negative integer and a0,a1,a2,…an∈R.  
For example, the graph of the polynomial function f(x)=x3+2x2–1 is drawn as:

![](https://d2cyt36b7wnvt9.cloudfront.net/exams/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21213050/137.jpg)

### 11. Rational Function

Rational functions have a form f(x)g(x), where f(x) and g(x) are polynomial functions and g(x)≠0.  
For example, the graph of the rational function f(x)=x+1x2–2 is drawn as:
