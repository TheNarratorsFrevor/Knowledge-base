In mathematics, a group is a fundamental algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements together with an operation that combines any two elements to produce a third element. The operation must satisfy certain properties to qualify as a group.

Formally, a group is defined as a set G along with a binary operation (often denoted as *) that satisfies the following three axioms:

1. Closure: For any two elements a and b in G, the operation a * b is also in G. In other words, combining any two elements of the group using the operation yields another element within the group.
    
2. Associativity: For any three elements a, b, and c in G, the operation is associative, meaning (a * b) * c = a * (b * c). The order in which the operations are performed does not affect the result.
    
3. Identity element: There exists an element e in G, called the identity element, such that for any element a in G, a * e = e * a = a. The identity element acts as a neutral element under the operation.
    
4. Inverse element: For every element a in G, there exists an element b in G, called the inverse of a, such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element. In other words, every element has an inverse that, when combined with the element, yields the identity element.
    

These axioms ensure that a group is a well-behaved structure, allowing for consistent and predictable mathematical operations. Groups have various applications in algebra, number theory, geometry, and other branches of mathematics.
