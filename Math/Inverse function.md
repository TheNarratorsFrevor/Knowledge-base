An **inverse function** or an anti function is defined as a function, which can reverse into another function. In simple words, if any function “f” takes x to y then, the inverse of “f” will take y to x. If the function is denoted by ‘f’ or ‘F’, then the inverse function is denoted by f\-1 or $F^{-1}$. One should not confuse (-1) with exponent or reciprocal here. 

> If f and g are inverse functions, then $f(x)= y$ if and only if $g(y) = x$

In trigonometry, the [[Inverse triogeometry functions]] is used to find the measure of angle for which sine function generated the value. For example, sin\-1(1) = sin\-1(sin 90) = 90 degrees. Hence, sin 90 degrees is equal to 1.
