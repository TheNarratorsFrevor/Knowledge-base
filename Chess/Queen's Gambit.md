**2…c6**

This is the [[Slav defense]] Black tries to solidify the d-pawn. Play normally continues with 3. Nf3 Nf6. Then black can decide if they want to bring the light square bishop into the mix before they play e6. If black decides to play e6 before the light square bishops moves, this is the [[Semi slav defense]] and is also very popular.
Here's the semi slav:

**2…e6**

This is the Orthodox line. Black prepares to get the dark square bishop involved into the game. Most of the development in this line comes from the material on the king side.
