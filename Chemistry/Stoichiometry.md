# Stoichiometry

Stoichiometry is a branch of chemistry that deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions. It allows us to determine the amounts of substances involved in a reaction, based on the balanced chemical equation. Stoichiometry is crucial for understanding and predicting the outcome of chemical reactions.

## Mole Concept

The mole concept is a fundamental principle in stoichiometry. It relates the mass of a substance to the number of its constituent particles, such as atoms, molecules, or ions. The Avogadro's number, denoted as $N_A$, represents the number of particles in one mole of a substance, which is approximately $6.022 \times 10^{23}$.

## Stoichiometric Calculations

Stoichiometry involves various types of calculations, including:

### 1. Molar Mass

The molar mass of a substance is the mass of one mole of that substance. It is calculated by summing the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule. The unit for molar mass is grams per mole (g/mol).

### 2. Stoichiometric Ratios

Stoichiometric ratios are derived from the balanced chemical equation. They represent the mole-to-mole relationship between reactants and products. These ratios allow us to determine the relative amounts of substances involved in a reaction.

### 3. Limiting Reactant

The limiting reactant is the substance that is completely consumed in a chemical reaction, thereby limiting the amount of product that can be formed. To identify the limiting reactant, stoichiometric calculations are performed using the mole ratios and the amounts of reactants given.

### 4. Percent Yield

The percent yield is a measure of the efficiency of a chemical reaction, indicating the percentage of the theoretical yield that is obtained in practice. It is calculated by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and multiplying by 100.

## Steps for Stoichiometric Calculations

Stoichiometric calculations typically involve the following steps:

1. **Write a Balanced Chemical Equation:** Start by writing a balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

2. **Determine the Known and Unknown Quantities:** Identify the quantities given in the problem and the quantity you need to find.

3. **Convert the Known Quantity to Moles:** Use the molar mass to convert the known quantity to moles.

4. **Use Stoichiometric Ratios:** Utilize the stoichiometric ratios from the balanced equation to relate the moles of the known substance to the moles of the unknown substance.

5. **Convert Moles to the Desired Unit:** If necessary, convert the moles of the unknown substance to the desired unit (e.g., grams, liters, etc.).

6. **Check for Limiting Reactant:** Determine the limiting reactant if more than one reactant is involved. Adjust the stoichiometric ratios accordingly.

7. **Calculate the Unknown Quantity:** Use the stoichiometric ratios and the moles of the unknown substance to calculate the desired quantity.

8. **Evaluate Percent Yield:** If provided with actual and theoretical yields, calculate the percent yield of the reaction.

## Formulas and Relationships

Here are some important formulas and relationships related to stoichiometry:

1. Molar Mass:
$$\text{Molar mass} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Moles}}$$

2. Mole Ratio:
$$\text{Mole ratio} = \frac{\text{Moles of substance A}}{\text{Moles of substance B}}$$

3. Percent Yield:
$$\text{Percent yield} = \frac{\text{Actual yield}}{\text{Theoretical yield}} \times 100$$
