# pH and pOH

pH and pOH are measures used to quantify the acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of a solution. They are logarithmic scales derived from the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻) in a solution, respectively. pH is commonly used to describe acidic solutions, while pOH is used for basic solutions.

## pH Scale

The pH scale is a logarithmic scale that measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. It ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 considered neutral. Values below 7 indicate acidic solutions, while values above 7 indicate basic solutions.

The mathematical expression for pH is:

$$\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]$$

where [H⁺] represents the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (mol/L) or molarity.

## pOH Scale

The pOH scale is also a logarithmic scale but measures the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution. It is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration. Similar to pH, pOH values range from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral.

The mathematical expression for pOH is:

$$\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-]$$

where [OH⁻] represents the concentration of hydroxide ions in mol/L.

## Relationship between pH and pOH

pH and pOH are related by the equation:

$$\text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14$$

This relationship holds true for aqueous solutions at 25 degrees Celsius.

## Calculating pH and pOH

To calculate pH or pOH, you need to know the concentration of hydrogen ions or hydroxide ions in the solution. If you know the concentration of one, you can use the relationship [H⁺] × [OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25 degrees Celsius) to determine the concentration of the other.

For example, if you have the concentration of hydrogen ions, you can use the following equation to calculate the pH:

$$\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]$$

Similarly, if you have the concentration of hydroxide ions, you can calculate the pOH using the equation:

$$\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-]$$

## pH Indicators

pH indicators are substances that change color depending on the pH of the solution. They are often used to estimate the pH of a solution visually. Common examples include litmus paper, phenolphthalein, bromothymol blue, and universal indicator.

## Neutralization and the pH of Water

In pure water, the concentration of hydrogen ions is equal to the concentration of hydroxide ions, resulting in a neutral solution. At 25 degrees Celsius, the concentration of each ion is 1.0 × 10⁻⁷ mol/L. Therefore, the pH of pure water is 7, and the pOH is also 7.

## Formulas and Relationships

Here are some key formulas and relationships regarding pH and pOH:

- pH: $\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]$
- pOH: $\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-]$
- Relationship between pH and pOH: $\text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14$
- Relationship between hydrogen and hydroxide ion concentrations in water: $[H^+] \times [OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}$ (at 25 degrees Celsius)
