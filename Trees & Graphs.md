# trees & graphs

trees and graphs are the backbone of data structures that model relationships and hierarchies. they overlap but serve different purposes. trees are a special kind of graphâ€”specifically, an acyclic connected graph with a hierarchical structure.

## basics

- **graph:** a set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (links). can be **directed** or **undirected**. edges can have weights or be unweighted.
  
- **tree:** a connected, acyclic, undirected graph. it has exactly $n-1$ edges for $n$ nodes, no cycles, and exactly one path between any two nodes.

- **rooted tree:** a tree with a designated root node; all edges implicitly point away from the root (parent to child).

- **binary tree:** each node has at most two children (left, right).

- **forest:** a collection of disjoint trees.

## advanced concepts

- **graph representations:**

  - **adjacency list:** stores edges as lists per node, efficient for sparse graphs.
  
  - **adjacency matrix:** 2D matrix $n \times n$ indicating edge presence/weight, good for dense graphs but uses more space.
  
  - **edge list:** simple list of edges, useful for some algorithms like kruskal.

- **graph types:**

  - **directed acyclic graph (dag):** directed graph with no cycles, used in scheduling, dependency resolution.
  
  - **weighted graph:** edges carry weights (costs, distances).
  
  - **bipartite graph:** nodes divided into two sets, edges only go between sets.
  
  - **cyclic vs acyclic:** cycle = path that starts and ends on the same node.
  
- **tree traversals:**

  - **dfs (depth-first search):** **go deep before wide**, uses stack/recursion.
  
  - **bfs (breadth-first search):** go **level by level**, uses queue.
  
  - **preorder, inorder, postorder:** specific DFS orders on rooted trees, important for expression trees, parsing.

- **key algorithms:**

  - **minimum spanning tree (mst):** find subset of edges connecting all nodes with minimal total weight. algorithms: kruskal, prim.
  
  - **shortest path:** dijkstra (non-negative weights), bellman-ford (can handle negative edges), floyd-warshall (all pairs).
  
  - **topological sort:** linear ordering of dag nodes, no edge points backward.

- **special trees:**

  - **binary search tree (bst):** left child < parent < right child, enables $O(\log n)$ avg searches.
  
  - **balanced trees:** avl, red-black, to maintain height $O(\log n)$ for efficiency.
  
  - **trie:** prefix tree used for fast string lookup.
