# Introduction
Surface tension is a property of liquids that arises from the cohesive forces between molecules at the surface. It is the result of the imbalance in intermolecular forces experienced by molecules on the surface of a liquid compared to those in the bulk. This topic explores the concept of surface tension, its definition, and some key phenomena associated with it.

## Definition of Surface Tension
Surface tension can be defined as the force per unit length exerted parallel to the surface of a liquid, tangential to the surface and perpendicular to any line drawn on the surface. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$\text{T} = \frac{\Delta \text{F}}{\Delta \text{L}}$$

where:
- $\text{T}$ represents the surface tension
- $\Delta \text{F}$ is a small force acting on a line segment on the surface of the liquid
- $\Delta \text{L}$ denotes the length of the line segment

## Molecular Explanation of Surface Tension
Surface tension can be understood by considering the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules. The molecules at the surface experience a net inward force due to the unbalanced cohesive forces from neighboring molecules. This force creates a "skin" or "film" on the surface, causing the liquid to behave as if it has a stretched elastic membrane.

## Capillary Action
Capillary action is a phenomenon that results from the combined effects of adhesion and surface tension. When a narrow tube (capillary) is inserted into a liquid, the liquid rises or falls inside the tube. The height to which the liquid rises (or falls) is determined by the balance between adhesive forces (attraction to the tube wall) and cohesive forces (attraction between liquid molecules). The rise or fall of the liquid can be described using the following equation:

$$h = \frac{{2 \cdot \text{T} \cdot \cos(\theta)}}{{\rho \cdot g \cdot r}}$$

where:
- $h$ represents the height in the capillary
- $\text{T}$ denotes the surface tension of the liquid
- $\theta$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the tube wall
- $\rho$ represents the density of the liquid
- $g$ denotes the acceleration due to gravity
- $r$ signifies the radius of the capillary tube

## Young-Laplace Equation
The Young-Laplace equation describes the relationship between the curvature of a liquid interface, the pressure difference across the interface, and the surface tension. It can be expressed as:

$$\Delta P = \frac{{2 \cdot \text{T}}}{{r}}$$

where:
- $\Delta P$ represents the pressure difference across the curved interface
- $\text{T}$ denotes the surface tension
- $r$ signifies the radius of curvature of the interface

# Equations and Relationships
