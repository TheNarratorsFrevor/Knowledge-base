# Principles of Geometric Optics

Geometric optics is a branch of optics that focuses on the behavior of light as it travels in straight lines and interacts with surfaces and interfaces. It provides a simplified model for the study of light without considering its wave nature. In this topic, we will explore the fundamental principles of geometric optics.

## Reflection of Light

When light encounters a surface separating two different optical media, such as air and glass, it can undergo reflection or refraction. Reflection occurs when light rays bounce off the surface. The law of reflection states that:

$$\text{Angle of incidence} = \text{Angle of reflection}$$

where both angles are measured with respect to the surface normal. This principle allows us to predict the direction of reflected light.

## Refraction of Light

Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different optical density. The bending occurs due to the change in the speed of light. Snell's law governs the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction:

$$\frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{\sin(\theta_2)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$$

where $\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence, $\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the velocities of light in the respective media, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media.

## Lenses

Lenses are transparent optical devices that refract light to converge or diverge it. They are classified into two categories:

1. **Convex (Converging) lenses**: These lenses are thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges. They converge incident parallel rays of light to a focal point. The distance between the lens's optical center and the focal point is called the focal length ($f$). The lens equation relates the object distance ($d_o$), image distance ($d_i$), and focal length:

   $$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$

2. **Concave (Diverging) lenses**: These lenses are thinner in the middle and thicker at the edges. They cause parallel rays of light to diverge as if they originated from a focal point behind the lens. The focal length of a concave lens is negative.

## Mirrors

Mirrors also play a significant role in geometric optics. They are categorized into two types:

1. **Concave mirrors**: These mirrors curve inward, and their reflecting surface faces the center of curvature. Concave mirrors can form both real and virtual images. The magnification produced by a mirror is given by:

   $$\text{Magnification (M)} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$

   where $d_i$ is the image distance and $d_o$ is the object distance.

2. **Convex mirrors**: These mirrors curve outward, and their reflecting surface bulges away from the center of curvature. Convex mirrors only produce virtual images that are upright and diminished in size compared to the object.

- Snell's Law: $$\frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{\sin(\theta_2)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
- Lens Equation: $$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}$$
- Magnification (Mirrors): $$\text{Magnification (M)} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$
