The ideal gas law is a fundamental equation in thermodynamics that describes the behavior of an ideal gas. It establishes a relationship between the pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), temperature ($T$), and the number of moles of gas ($n$). The equation is given by:

$$PV = nRT$$

where:

- $P$ represents the pressure of the gas (in units of force per unit area, such as pascals or atmospheres),
- $V$ represents the volume occupied by the gas (in units of cubic meters or liters),
- $n$ represents the number of moles of gas,
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and
- $T$ represents the temperature of the gas (in units of kelvin).

The ideal gas law assumes that the gas being studied behaves ideally, meaning that its particles have negligible volume and do not interact with each other except during collisions. In reality, real gases deviate from ideal behavior under certain conditions, such as high pressures or low temperatures. However, the ideal gas law provides a useful approximation for many practical situations.
