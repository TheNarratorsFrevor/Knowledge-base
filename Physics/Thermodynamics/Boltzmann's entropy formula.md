Boltzmann's entropy formula is given by $S = k \ln W$, where $S$ represents the entropy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $W$ is the number of [[Microstates]] corresponding to a given [[Macrostate]].

To understand the derivation of Boltzmann's entropy formula, let's consider a system in equilibrium described by its macrostate. A macrostate is characterized by macroscopic variables such as temperature, volume, and energy. Within this macrostate, the system can occupy different microstates, which represent the specific arrangements or distributions of the system's constituent particles consistent with the macroscopic variables.

The fundamental idea behind the derivation is that in equilibrium, all accessible microstates are equally probable. Therefore, the entropy of the system is related to the number of microstates available to it.

Now, let's derive Boltzmann's entropy formula step by step:

1. Consider a system with a certain number of [[particles]] and [[energy levels]]. The total number of microstates accessible to the system is denoted by $W$.
    
2. The probability of finding the system in a specific microstate $i$ is given by $P(i)$. Since all microstates are equally probable in equilibrium, we have $P(i) = \frac{1}{W}$ for each microstate.
    
3. The entropy $S$ is defined as a measure of the system's disorder or randomness. It is related to the probabilities $P(i)$ through the formula $S = -k \sum P(i) \ln P(i)$, where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.
    
4. Substituting $P(i) = \frac{1}{W}$ into the entropy formula, we have $S = -k \sum \frac{1}{W} \ln \left(\frac{1}{W}\right)$.
    
5. Simplifying the expression, we get $S = k \ln W \left(\frac{1}{W}\right) \sum 1$, which further simplifies to $S = k \ln W$.
    

Therefore, we obtain Boltzmann's entropy formula, which states that the entropy $S$ of a system is given by $S = k \ln W$, where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $W$ is the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate.

This derivation highlights the connection between entropy and the number of microstates, emphasizing that the more microstates a system can occupy, the higher its entropy. Boltzmann's entropy formula is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics and provides a quantitative measure of the system's disorder or randomness based on microscopic considerations.
