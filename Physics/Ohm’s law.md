# Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. It states that the current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor.

## Formulation

Mathematically, Ohm's Law can be expressed using the following equation:

$$V = I \cdot R$$

where:

- $V$ represents the voltage across the conductor (measured in volts, V).
- $I$ represents the current flowing through the conductor (measured in amperes, A).
- $R$ represents the resistance of the conductor (measured in ohms, Î©).

## Relationships

Ohm's Law provides the foundation for understanding the behavior of electrical circuits. It establishes the following relationships:

1. **Voltage-Current Relationship**: The voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, given a constant resistance. This can be expressed as:

$$V \propto I$$

2. **Voltage-Resistance Relationship**: The voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to its resistance, given a constant current. This can be expressed as:

$$V \propto R$$

3. **Current-Resistance Relationship**: The current flowing through a conductor is inversely proportional to its resistance, given a constant voltage. This can be expressed as:

$$I \propto \frac{1}{R}$$

## Practical Applications

Ohm's Law is the basis for many practical applications in electrical engineering. Here are a few examples:

- **Circuit Analysis**: Ohm's Law is used to analyze and calculate the behavior of electrical circuits. By applying the law to different components and connecting them in various configurations, engineers can determine voltages, currents, and resistances within the circuit.
    
- **Designing Circuits**: When designing electrical circuits, Ohm's Law helps engineers select appropriate resistors to achieve desired voltage and current levels. It ensures that the circuit components are properly matched to avoid overload or underutilization.
    
- **Power Calculation**: Ohm's Law can be used to calculate the power dissipated in a circuit component. The power (P) can be determined using the following equation:
    

$$P = I \cdot V$$

where:

- $P$ represents the power dissipated (measured in watts, W).
- $I$ represents the current flowing through the component.
- $V$ represents the voltage across the component.
