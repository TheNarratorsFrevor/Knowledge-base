# Newton's Third Law

Newton's third law of motion, also known as the law of action and reaction, is one of the fundamental principles in classical mechanics. This law describes the relationship between the forces acting on two interacting objects. In this note, we will explore Newton's third law in detail, discuss its implications, and provide a cheat sheet summarizing the key points.

## Newton's Third Law Statement

Newton's third law can be stated as follows:

**For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.**

This means that whenever an object exerts a force on a second object, the second object simultaneously exerts a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on the first object. The forces are always paired and act on different objects.

## Key Points

Here are some key points to understand and apply Newton's third law:

1. **Action and Reaction Forces**: The forces involved in Newton's third law are referred to as action and reaction forces. They act on different objects and have equal magnitudes but opposite directions.

2. **Force Pairs**: Action and reaction forces always occur in pairs. If object A exerts a force on object B, then object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A. These forces are part of the same interaction.

3. **Independent Objects**: The action and reaction forces act on different objects and are independent of each other. They do not cancel each other out since they act on separate entities.

4. **Different Effects**: Although the action and reaction forces have the same magnitude, they can have different effects on the objects they act upon. This is because the forces are applied to different masses or have different accelerations.

5. **Types of Interactions**: Newton's third law applies to all types of interactions, including contact forces (e.g., pushing, pulling) and non-contact forces (e.g., gravitational, electromagnetic).

6. **Conservation of Momentum**: Newton's third law is closely related to the conservation of momentum. The action and reaction forces result in an exchange of momentum between the objects involved in the interaction, while the total momentum of the system remains constant.
