[[Newtonian Mechanics]]:

- Based on Newton's laws of motion.
- Describes the motion of particles and objects in terms of forces acting on them.
- Uses vector quantities such as position, velocity, and acceleration.
- Employs Newton's second law (F = ma) to relate forces, mass, and acceleration.
- Focuses on the concept of absolute time and space.
- Suitable for describing simple systems with a small number of particles.

[[Lagrangian Mechanics]]:

- Formulated based on the principle of least action.
- Describes the motion of particles and systems using generalized coordinates.
- Introduces the Lagrangian function, which is the difference between kinetic and potential energies.
- Utilizes the Euler-Lagrange equations to derive the equations of motion.
- Allows for the treatment of constraints and generalized forces.
- Provides a systematic and concise approach to solving complex problems.
- Independent of the choice of coordinates, making it suitable for handling different coordinate systems.

[[Hamiltonian Mechanics]]:

- Derived from Lagrangian mechanics by introducing conjugate momenta.
- Uses generalized coordinates and their corresponding momenta.
- Introduces the Hamiltonian function, which is the sum of kinetic and potential energies.
- Hamilton's equations of motion describe the evolution of coordinates and momenta with respect to time.
- Treats time as an independent variable rather than a parameter.
- Provides a symplectic structure to phase space, preserving volume during motion.
- Useful for problems involving symmetries, canonical transformations, and conservation laws.
- Has connections with quantum mechanics through the concept of canonical quantization.
