Starting with this equation: 

$$\Delta X .\Delta P \ge \frac{h}{4\pi}$$
$\Delta X$ is the uncertainty in an objects position, while $\Delta P$ is it's uncertainty in momentum.
The more you know about the particle's position, the less you know about it's momentum and vice-verca.
It doesn't apply for objects that are very large, hence why $\frac{h}{4\pi}$ is a very small number.
The behavior of small things are rather unpredictable, and you need to talk in probability, rather than exact values.

say we are flipping a coin, we cannot guess with certainty what the outcome of the flip may be, but if we flip a coin a hundred times, we can say that there's probably 40 - 60 heads, and 40 - 60 tails. if we say there's probably 50 heads and 50 tails, there's a small chance of that actually happening, there's variance to this data.

#### Problem #1

- What is the uncertainty in the position of an electron given and uncertainty value of 0.15m/s in the velocity of the electron? 

well, we have $\Delta x = ?$ and $\Delta p = 0.15\frac{m}{s}$, and the mass of an electron is roughly $m = 9.11*10^{-31}kg$ and according to the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, $\Delta x.\Delta p=\frac{h}{4\pi}$, thus we can calculate: $\Delta x \ge \frac{h}{4\pi \Delta p} = \frac{h}{4\pi m\Delta v}$, we can calculate that to be: $\Delta x = 386\mu m$, which is the uncertainty in the electron's position.



-  What is the uncertainty in the position of a $2kg$ ball given and uncertainty value of 0.15 m/s in the velocity of the ball?

if we use the same relationship that we used for the first part, we can calculate $\Delta x = 1.76 * 10^{-29}\micro m$, and if we pay close attention to this number, we can see that it is incredibly small, thus meaning that the uncertainty number is very small, therefore the position is not uncertain.
