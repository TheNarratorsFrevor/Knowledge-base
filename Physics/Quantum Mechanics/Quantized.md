A quantized value refers to a value that is restricted to specific discrete or distinct values rather than being continuous. In other words, it means that the value can only exist in specific, well-defined quantities or levels, with no intermediate values allowed.

Quantization is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, where physical quantities such as energy, momentum, and angular momentum are observed to be quantized. This means that these quantities can only take on certain discrete values, and any intermediate values are not allowed.

For example, the energy levels of electrons in an atom are quantized. Electrons can only occupy specific energy levels, and the energy difference between these levels is fixed. They cannot have any arbitrary energy value between these levels. Similarly, the angular momentum of an electron in an atom is quantized, meaning it can only have certain specific values.

Quantization arises due to the wave-particle duality and the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. It implies that certain physical properties can only exist in discrete "chunks" or quantized amounts, rather than having a continuous range of values.

Quantization has profound implications for the behavior and properties of quantum systems. It governs phenomena such as the emission and absorption of photons, the stability of atomic and molecular structures, and the behavior of subatomic particles.

Quantized systems in quantum mechanics:

1. [[Energy levels]] of electrons in atoms and molecules: The energy levels that electrons can occupy are discrete and quantized in quantum mechanics. These energy levels are responsible for various atomic and molecular phenomena, such as emission and absorption spectra.
    
2. [[Atomic and molecular vibrations]]: In quantum mechanics, the vibrational motion of atoms in molecules is quantized. The vibrational energy levels correspond to discrete vibrational states of the molecule.
    
3. [[Electron spin]]: The intrinsic angular momentum or spin of an electron is quantized, meaning it can only take on specific values determined by quantum mechanics.
    
4. [[Nuclear spin]]: Similar to electron spin, the spin of atomic nuclei is also quantized. Different isotopes of an element can have different nuclear spin values.
    
5. [[Harmonic oscillators]]: The energy levels of a harmonic oscillator, such as a vibrating string or a quantum mechanical oscillator, are quantized.
    

Continuous systems in classical mechanics:

1. [[Motion of macroscopic objects]]: Classical mechanics describes the motion of objects on a macroscopic scale, such as the motion of planets, projectiles, or vehicles. In classical mechanics, the position, velocity, and other properties of these objects can take on a continuous range of values.
    
2. [[Waves]]: Classical wave phenomena, such as sound waves or electromagnetic waves, are described as continuous in classical mechanics. The wave properties, such as wavelength, frequency, and amplitude, can vary continuously.
    
3. [[Fluid dynamics]]: The behavior of fluids, such as the flow of liquids or gases, is described as continuous in classical mechanics.
    
4. [[Classical electromagnetic fields]]: In classical electromagnetism, the electric and magnetic fields are described as continuous quantities that can vary smoothly in space and time.
