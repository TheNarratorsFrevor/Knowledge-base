[[Quantum Mechanics]]
In physics, energy levels refer to the [[Quantized]] states of energy that a system can possess. These energy levels are a fundamental concept in various branches of physics, including quantum mechanics and atomic physics.

In classical physics, energy is considered to be continuous, meaning that a system can have any energy value within a given range. However, in quantum mechanics, energy is quantized, which means it can only exist in discrete, distinct values. These discrete energy levels are often represented by a series of allowed energy values that a system can have.

The concept of energy levels is most commonly associated with electrons in atoms. According to quantum mechanics, electrons in an atom can only occupy specific energy levels, which are often represented by different electron shells or orbitals. The lowest energy level, called the ground state, is the most stable state for the electron. As the electron gains energy, it can transition to higher energy levels, which are called excited states.

The energy levels of electrons in an atom are determined by the atom's electronic structure, which is described by the Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics. The equation provides solutions that correspond to the allowed energy levels and wavefunctions of the electrons in the atom.

Energy levels are also observed in other physical systems, such as molecules, nuclei, and even subatomic particles. Each of these systems has its own set of energy levels, which determine the behavior and properties of the system.

The energy levels of a system can be influenced by external factors, such as the application of an electric field or the interaction with other particles. These external influences can cause transitions between energy levels, resulting in the emission or absorption of photons or other forms of energy.

1. Energy of a [[photon]]:  
    $E = hf$  
    where $E$ is the energy of the photon, $h$ is the [[Planck's constant]] $h = 6.62607015 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s, and $f$ is the frequency of the photon.
    
2. Energy levels in an [[atom]]:  
    $E_n = -\frac{13.6 \text{eV}}{n^2}$  
    where $E_n$ represents the energy level of the electron in the hydrogen atom or hydrogen-like ions, $n$ is the principal quantum number, and $-13.6$ eV represents the ionization energy of hydrogen.
    
3. Bohr energy levels in a [[hydrogen-like atom]]:  
    $E_n = -\frac{Z^2 \cdot 13.6 \text{eV}}{n^2}$  
    where $Z$ is the atomic number of the atom, $E_n$ is the energy level of the electron, and $n$ is the principal quantum number.
    
4. Energy of an electron in a [[quantum well]]:  
    $E_n = \frac{n^2 \cdot \pi^2 \cdot \hbar^2}{2mL^2}$  
    where $E_n$ represents the energy level of the electron in the quantum well, $n$ is the quantum number, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$, $m$ is the mass of the electron, and $L$ is the width of the quantum well.
    
5. Energy levels in a [[harmonic oscillator]]:  
    $E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$  
    where $E_n$ represents the energy level of the harmonic oscillator, $n$ is the quantum number, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator.
