# Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's law is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism that describes the electrostatic interaction between charged particles. It was formulated by French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in the 18th century. Coulomb's law states that the force between two charged objects is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

## Statement of Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's law can be mathematically expressed as:

$$F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$

where:
- $F$ is the electrostatic force between the two charged objects,
- $k$ is the electrostatic constant, also known as Coulomb's constant, approximately equal to $8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}^2$,
- $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the charges of the two objects, and
- $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two objects.

The direction of the force is along the line connecting the two charged objects and depends on the sign of the charges. Like charges (either both positive or both negative) repel each other, while opposite charges attract.

## Electric Field

In addition to the force between charged objects, Coulomb's law can also be used to calculate the electric field generated by a charged object at a point in space. The electric field is a vector quantity that describes the force experienced by a positive test charge placed at that point.

The electric field is given by:

$$\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}$$

where:
- $\vec{E}$ is the electric field vector,
- $\vec{F}$ is the electrostatic force vector exerted by the charged object,
- $q_0$ is the magnitude of the test charge.

## Superposition Principle

One of the important aspects of Coulomb's law is the principle of superposition. According to this principle, the total electric force on a charged object due to multiple other charges is the vector sum of the forces exerted by each individual charge.

Mathematically, for a system of charges, the net force on a particular charge is given by:

$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + \ldots + \vec{F}_n$$

where $\vec{F}_1$, $\vec{F}_2$, ..., $\vec{F}_n$ are the forces exerted by each individual charge.

## Formulas and Relationships

Here are some additional formulas and relationships related to Coulomb's law:

- Electric field due to a point charge: $\vec{E} = \frac{k q}{r^2} \hat{r}$, where $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector in the direction of the radial line connecting the charge and the point in space.

- Electric potential energy: $PE = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{r}$, where $PE$ is the potential energy, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges, and $r$ is the distance between them.

- Electric potential: $V = \frac{k q}{r}$, where $V$ is the electric potential at a point, $q$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge.

- Gauss's law: $\oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dA} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}$, where $\oint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dA}$ is the electric flux through a closed surface, $Q_{\text{enc}}$ is the total charge enclosed by the surface, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.
